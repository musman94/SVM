# SVM
SVM to predict if a person has breast cancer.    
The following are each method's functions:    
q3_3: Trains a linear SVM with a soft margin and finds the optimum value for C using k-fold cross validation. After training, tests the model on test set and reports the results.    
q3_4: Uses a RBF kernel to train a hard margin SVM model and finds the optimum value for Î³. After training, tests the model on the test set and reports the results.
